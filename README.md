This project is implemented using MERN stack. We are currently running this project on Render.com's free tier and Amazon S3's default free storage tier. That's why the file limit is set to 5 MB and 5 files in total. If you find any bugs or just want to show your support reach out to any of us via the emails/socials provided on the site. We will deeply appreciate it. We also hope this project makes your day easier in any way.
